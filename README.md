# Cluster Analysis Project
This project uses the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset from Kaggle. Our team first conducted an exploratory analysis to find distribution amongst the various variables, followed by potential correlation amongst selected variables. To visualize potential outcomes we performed two types of cluster analysis' on the data: one analysis with variables standardized and scaled, and one analysis with non-scaled and non-standardized variables. The purpose of this methodology was to highlight potential issues that can arise from not standardizing and scaling variables to our peers and professor. Following the visualization of the identified clusters, we utilized cross tabulation to identify the best cluster to use for marketing efforts.
